                <h2>Beef and mushroom burger recipe </h2>
                <img src="./img7.jpg" alt="Dish 1">
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> ½ tbsp olive oil </li>
                    <li>4 large field mushrooms, very finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
                    <li>30g flat leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>500g lean beef steak mince 5% fat</li>
                    <li>For the burger sauce</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp half-fat soured cream</li>
                    <li> 1 tbsp sriracha chilli sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp dill, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>To serve </li>
                    <li>4 wholemeal baps, halved</li>
                    <li> 1 x 160g pack beetroot salad</li>
                    <li> ½ lemon, juice</li>
                    <li> 1 large tomato, sliced</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>Method<li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, then add the mushrooms. Cook over a high heat for 5-6
                        mins, stirring regularly, until softened and any excess liquid has evaporated. Stir in the
                        garlic and half the parsley, then tip onto a plate to cool. </li>
                    <li>Roughly break up the beef mince in a large bowl and add the cooled mushrooms. Mix together, then
                        divide into 4. Shape into burgers, transfer to a tray and cover with clingfilm; chill for at
                        least 2 hrs to firm up.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make the burger sauce by mixing together all the ingredients and the remaining
                        parsley in a small bowl. Cover and chill until ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>Preheat a barbecue or griddle pan. Season the burgers on both sides before placing on the grill.
                        Cook for 6-7 mins each side on the barbecue, or 5-6 mins each side on the griddle pan. Remove
                        from heat and allow to rest for a few mins.</li>
                    <li>Toast the cut sides of the baps on the barbecue or griddle for 20-30 secs. Put the beetroot
                        salad in a bowl and toss with the lemon juice and a little seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Pile some of the beetroot salad on the base of each bap, top with a few tomato slices, then add
                        a burger. Spoon on a dollop of the burger sauce and finish with the top bap. Serve with the
                        remaining salad on the side.</li>
                    <p>Tip: Pat the tomato slices between 2 pieces of kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture <br> –
                        this will help stop the burgers going soggy.

                        The burgers can also be cooked in a non-stick frying pan. Cook for the same time as for the
                        griddle pan.

                        Freezing and defrosting guidelines<br>

                        Freeze uncooked burgers only. Once shaped, cover and freeze for 4 hrs or until solid.<br>
                        Transfer to a freezer-proof container or freezer bag and keep for up to 3 months. Defrost fully
                        before cooking as above.

                        <br> In order to enjoy optimum flavour and quality, frozen items are best used within 3 months
                        of
                        their freezing date. For more tips on freezing and defrosting food, read our article Love Your
