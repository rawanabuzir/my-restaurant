            <p style="font-size: 25;">Easy homemade beef burger recipe &#127828;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20;">Ingredients <br>

                ½ tbsp olive oil <br>
                1 onion, peeled and finely chopped<br>
                1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat<br>
                1 tsp mixed dried herbs<br>
                1 egg, beaten<br>
                4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)<br>
                4 white rolls<br>
                few round lettuce leaves, torn<br>
                1 beef tomato, sliced<br>
                ketchup, to serve (optional)<br>
                <br>
            <ol>Method<li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened
                    and starting to turn golden. Set aside. </li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix
                    well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.</li>
                <li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the
                    second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce,
                    burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</li>

            <p style="font-size: 25;">Beef and mushroom burger recipe &#127828;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20;">Ingredients <br>

                ½ tbsp olive oil <br>
                4 large field mushrooms, very finely chopped <br>
                1 garlic clove, crushed <br>
                30g flat leaf parsley, finely chopped <br>
                500g lean beef steak mince 5% fat <br>
                For the burger sauce <br>
                4 tbsp half-fat soured cream <br>
                1 tbsp sriracha chilli sauce <br>
                1 tbsp dill, finely chopped <br>
                To serve <br>
                4 wholemeal baps, halved <br>
                1 x 160g pack beetroot salad <br>
                ½ lemon, juiced <br>
                1 large tomato, sliced <br>
            <ol>Method<li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, then add the mushrooms. Cook over a high heat for 5-6
                    mins, stirring regularly, until softened and any excess liquid has evaporated. Stir in the
                    garlic and half the parsley, then tip onto a plate to cool. </li>
                <li>Roughly break up the beef mince in a large bowl and add the cooled mushrooms. Mix together, then
                    divide into 4. Shape into burgers, transfer to a tray and cover with clingfilm; chill for at
                    least 2 hrs to firm up.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the burger sauce by mixing together all the ingredients and the remaining
                    parsley in a small bowl. Cover and chill until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Preheat a barbecue or griddle pan. Season the burgers on both sides before placing on the grill.
                    Cook for 6-7 mins each side on the barbecue, or 5-6 mins each side on the griddle pan. Remove
                    from heat and allow to rest for a few mins.</li>
                <li>Toast the cut sides of the baps on the barbecue or griddle for 20-30 secs. Put the beetroot
                    salad in a bowl and toss with the lemon juice and a little seasoning.</li>
                <li>Pile some of the beetroot salad on the base of each bap, top with a few tomato slices, then add
                    a burger. Spoon on a dollop of the burger sauce and finish with the top bap. Serve with the
                    remaining salad on the side.</li>
                <p>Tip: Pat the tomato slices between 2 pieces of kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture <br> –
                    this will help stop the burgers going soggy.

                    The burgers can also be cooked in a non-stick frying pan. Cook for the same time as for the
                    griddle pan.

                    Freezing and defrosting guidelines<br>

                    Freeze uncooked burgers only. Once shaped, cover and freeze for 4 hrs or until solid.<br>
                    Transfer to a freezer-proof container or freezer bag and keep for up to 3 months. Defrost fully
                    before cooking as above.

                    <br> In order to enjoy optimum flavour and quality, frozen items are best used within 3 months
                    of
                    their freezing date. For more tips on freezing and defrosting food, read our article Love Your
                    Freezer.
